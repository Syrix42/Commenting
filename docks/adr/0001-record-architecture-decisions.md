# 0001 - Record architecture decisions

Date: 2026-02-21

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a lightweight, reviewable way to document key architecture decisions for this project.

## Decision
We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) written in Markdown under `docs/adr/`.

## Consequences
- Decisions are traceable and easy to review in PRs.
- Adds a small documentation step whenever major decisions change.
